# Amazon-Retail-Database-Design-Analysis-MySQL-Project
This project centered around the design and implementation of a comprehensive database for managing transactions, sales, and product inventory within an Amazon retail environment. Starting from scratch, I conceptualized and created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the database schema, defining tables, columns, and relationships. Using MySQL, I populated the database with sample data and executed SQL queries to analyze sales trends, inventory levels, and customer behavior. The insights generated from the analysis informed strategic decision-making processes, enabling Amazon to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
